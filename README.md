# Simple Portfolio

*******************************************
## Overview
This project was designed as a way to showcase the projects I have created over the course of the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp.
There are three menu items at the top: the home page, a list of the pages I have created, and the contact information page.

## Information Contained
On each item in my portfolio, there is listed a brief description of the project, as well as a link to the respective GitHub and Hosted Website for each.

On the Contact tab, I have my contact email, phone number, as well as links to my LinkedIn and Github pages.

## Coding Practices

This website was created with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and vanilla Javascript.
